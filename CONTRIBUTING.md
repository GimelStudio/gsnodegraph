# Contributing to gsnodegraph

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. We're excited to have you!

gsnodegraph is a node graph widget built as a wxPython extension library originally created for use in [Gimel Studio](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio).

The main purpose of the gsnode graph package is to provide a powerful node graph widget for use in Gimel Studio. Since Gimel Studio directy relies on this package, some issues in the main Gimel Studio repository will make reference to something that needs to be fixed/implemented here.

Please see the Gimel Studio [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for overall guidelines and details on contributing.
